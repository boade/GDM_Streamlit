Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) Prediction
Introduction
Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is a form of diabetes that affects women during pregnancy. Early detection and management of GDM can significantly reduce the risk of complications for both the mother and the baby. This project aims to use supervised machine learning techniques to predict GDM.

File Descriptions
gestation_diabetes.csv - This data contains medical, physical, social and risk factors of gestation diabetes.

my_best_log1.pkl - A saved machine learning model that was trained on the data provided in gestation_diabetes.csv.

requirements.txt - A list of dependencies required to run the project using the Streamlit framework.

jupyter_notebook - A Jupyter Notebook containing the code and explanation of the machine learning model.

Usage
Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.

Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Streamlit app by executing the following command:
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
The app should now be accessible in your web browser at https://boade-gdm-streamlit-gdmstreamlit-rnrxdh.streamlit.app/.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning to predict GDM, which can help healthcare providers make early interventions and improve outcomes for pregnant women and their babies. The code and data provided in this repository can be used as a starting point for further research and development in this field.
